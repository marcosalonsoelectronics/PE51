In this second part we study how to make the current-controlled converter stable for operation at any duty cycle by adding an auxiliary ramp. We also analyze the operation in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to show that there is no stability issues when operation in DCM. Finally, the practical implementation of the auxiliary ramp is explained. Several LTspice simulations are shown to illustrate the different concepts.
